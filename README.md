# Topman Web Scraper Project

## Topman is a retail clothing brand based out of the UK and a personal favorite of mine when it comes to shopping for well-fitted clothes. After web scraping from Topman's website from June - August 2020 and aggregating this data, I created a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jason4347#!/vizhome/Topman-Dashboard/Topman) that can help visualize the percent changes of discounted shoe prices over time.

# UPDATE. Web scraper has been deprecated. Superseded code to come...
## Topman has recently been aquired by Asos thus making the web scraper no longer useable. For future Topman scraping I suggest using the following [link.](https://www.asos.com/us/men/a-to-z-of-brands/topman/cat/?cid=29065&nlid=mw|brands|top+brands|topman)
